        <h2>Aerodynamics in Mind</h2>
        <section>
            <p>There are multiple sections of the 911 GT3RS that are aerodynamic focused in order to produce downforce
                and save time on the track.
                For simplicty purposes, this site will cover three of the most important parts.
            </p>
            <div class="Aerodynamics_List">
                <ul>
                    <li>Front Trunk</li>
                    <li>Wheel Wells</li>
                    <li>Rear Wing</li>
                </ul>
            </div>


            <h3>Front Trunk</h3>
            <img src="https://images.hgmsites.net/med/2023-porsche-911-carrera_100875698_m.jpg" id="Frunk"
                alt="View of front hood lifted up to see there is no trunk.">
            <p>
                The 911 GT3RS has no front trunk! The trunk space has been converted into an airflow chamber where the
                hot air from the radiator flows out through the hood.
                This design works with the front splitter of the car to keep the downforce high so the car doesn't lift
                off the ground.
            </p>

            <h3>Wheel Wells</h3>
            <img src="https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/presto/2023/03/07/PDTN/ac6044a8-23c6-40ec-864e-514b30ce52c6-Porsche911GT3RS_wheel.jpg?width=700&height=377&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp"
                id="Wheel_wells" alt="View of wheel wells of the GT3RS.">
            <p>
                The wheel wells are the open areas of the car body where the wheels belong. These wheel wells have been
                designed to maximize good airflow and downforce. The air gets directed through the
                panels on the sides of the car (black panels infront of and behind the wheels). This makes sure that the
                airflow doesn't slow the car down (drag) and helps with downforce.
                The cutouts on the top of the fenders allow the air inside the wheel well to go out easily which also
                improves airflow and downforce.
            </p>

            <h3>Rear Wing</h3>
            <img src="https://newsroom.porsche.com/.imaging/mte/porsche-templating-theme/teaser_720x406x2/dam/US-local/Press-Releases/2022/August-2022/20220817-911-GT3-RS-Premiere/Exterieur/_AKOS5487_edit_RUNTER_V01_highres.jpeg/jcr:content/_AKOS5487_edit_RUNTER_V01_highres.jpeg"
                id="Wing" alt="Porsche's rear wing designed for maximum downforce.">
            <p>
                The rear wing is an active piece of the car that helps with drag and downforce. The top flap of the wing
                can actively be put into the closed position to help with downforce around
                corners, and can it be opened on straightaways to help reduce drag to make the car go faster.
