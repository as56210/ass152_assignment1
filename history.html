                Porsche was founded by Ferdinand Porsche on April 25, 1931 in Stuttgart, Germany. The company first started out in vehicle consulting and manufacturing for other car manufacturers. 
                It wasn't until 1948 that Porsche would start their own production of cars starting with the Porsche 356.

                The first 911 model was made on September 12, 1963, and its production started a year later in 1964. 
                Since 1963, there have been 8 generations of the 911. The most recent generation is the 992, which the 911 GT3RS falls under.

            <p>
                Porsche has sold around 1.2 million 911 model cars since 1963, which shows how successful the 911 has been.
                In terms of looks and performance, the 911 has been a favorite among car enthusists for generations.
